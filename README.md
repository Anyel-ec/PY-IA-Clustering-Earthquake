# Significant Earthquakes, 1965-2016

This project analyzes and visualizes data on significant earthquakes between 1965 and 2016 using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Author
**Angel Pati√±o - KMeans**

## Dataset
The dataset used can be found at [Kaggle - USGS Earthquake Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database).

## Description
This code analyzes earthquake data to identify patterns using clustering techniques (KMeans). It includes interactive visualizations of the results using tools such as Matplotlib, Plotly, Seaborn, and Folium.

## Requirements
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Folium
- Geopy

## Key Features
- Loading data from a CSV file.
- Analysis of missing values in the dataset.
- Outlier removal using Z-score.
- Data transformation to improve distribution.
- Application of KMeans to cluster earthquakes based on geospatial and seismic characteristics.
- Visualization of results using histograms, scatter plots, and interactive maps.

## Usage
To run the code, ensure you have installed all the libraries mentioned in the requirements and execute the main script.

## Example Output
The code produces visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and interactive maps showing the geographic distribution and characteristics of clustered earthquakes.
